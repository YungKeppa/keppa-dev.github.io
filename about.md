Hi, my name is Femi and I slave over a hot laptop for 12 hours a day with no appreciation.

This labor of love was made using a tool called Jekyll and is hosted for free on Github Pages.

This is the base Jekyll theme. You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/)

You can find the source code for the Jekyll new theme at: [github.com/jglovier/jekyll-new](https://github.com/jglovier/jekyll-new)
