<p>
DevOps
- Building the image, improving the pipeline there. Working across 3-4 different teams
- Notebook samples building, coordinating releases. Essentially wore a release manager hat
- On-call. Got on call with customers constantly. Have to try to repro the customer issue or explore their resources (security protocol needed/JIT)
- Adding RStudio support into the image
- Making the whole pipeline automated</p>
